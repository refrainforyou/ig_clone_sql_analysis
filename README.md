# 📸 Instagram Clone SQL Analysis

This project is a SQL-based analytical exploration of an Instagram-like relational database.  
It focuses on understanding user behavior, content performance, and engagement patterns through structured queries.

The analysis covers key product metrics such as user activity, popularity of content, social interactions (likes, comments, followers), and hashtag trends.  
Special attention is given to engagement measurement, identifying high-performing content, and detecting unusual or potentially automated (bot-like) behavior.

By working with multiple related tables (users, photos, likes, comments, follows, and tags), this project demonstrates the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex data structures and simulate real-world product analytics tasks.

## ⚙️ Skills Demonstrated

- SQL JOINs (INNER, LEFT)
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, AVG)
- Subqueries
- Handling duplicate rows in JOINs (DISTINCT)
- Analytical thinking and business metrics
- Social network data analysis

## 📂 Database Structure

The project is built on a relational database with the following tables:

- `users` – platform users  
- `photos` – uploaded images  
- `likes` – user likes on photos  
- `comments` – comments under photos  
- `follows` – follower-following relationships  
- `tags` – hashtags  
- `photo_tags` – many-to-many relationship between photos and tags

## 💡 Example: Engagement Score

```sql
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.image_url,
  COUNT(DISTINCT l.user_id) AS likes,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) AS comments,
  COUNT(DISTINCT l.user_id) + COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) AS engagement
FROM photos p
LEFT JOIN likes l ON p.id = l.photo_id
LEFT JOIN comments c ON p.id = c.photo_id
GROUP BY p.id
ORDER BY engagement DESC;
